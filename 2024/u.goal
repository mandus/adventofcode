zip:{,/x,'y} / zip each of x with each of y; lengths must match
mzip:{(#x)$zip[,/x;,/y]} / zip two matrix with same number of rows
mz:{,/'+'+(x;y)} / more idiomatic row-wise zip, suggested from ngn
/ mz:{(#x)$,/+,/'(x;y)} / maybe faster, but need the reshape
gr:{x#'(y#0)} / grid of zeros, height x times width y. 
/ map a list of dicts x by key y - use as u.mld[dictlist;key]
mld:{(x@`y)!x}
